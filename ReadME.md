This is a The Odin Project Ruby Course project. Simple Tic-Tac-Toe. Main features as I saw it were:

* a player class to keep name / token (X-O)
* a board class to maintain selections, update each turn, and check for winners
* a game play class to keep track of whose turn


Will revisit someday to clean it up as I learn more!
